# This Person does not Exist - An Exploration

Generative Adversial Networks (GANs) are a type of neural network that specializes in generating new content. The most famous application of a GAN is [This person does not exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/), which uses one to generate faces of people that do not exist to unprecedented levels of authenticity. The website uses the StyleGAN 2 algorithm authored by Karras et al [1], which improved a lot of the shortcomings of previous generative models such as more natural looking eyes and teeth. Most of the generated images look so photorealistic that even the creator of the website is concerned about potential social ramifications. For instance, many fake accounts accross various social media have been shown to be using images generated by AI models [2].

As accurate as some of the faces look, just in a couple of refreshes I was able to spot a few problems. Firstly, the algorithm is a lot better at generating some faces than others. One particular flaw it had was generating facial accesories. Take this face with feminine South Asian features.

Being Bangladeshi myself and familiar with various cultures of the Indian subcontinent, I can guess the headdress the person in the image is wearing is meant to be a _bridal orna or dupatta_. However it does not take close inspection to reveal that the clothing does not seem right with portions of the person's hair being somehow both behind and on top of the fabric. The draping on the right side of the image is also unnaturally clinging to the neck. Another misplaced accessory is the _bindi_ on the forehead. Typically, this Indian accessory is a full circle but in the picture it seems to resemble a crescent moon. This is unlikely to be possible since the full circle of the _bindi_ is necessary in order to properly grip the skin.

Observing this I hypothesized that accessories in general are a weakness in the StyleGAN2 algorithm. As certain cultures prefer facial accessories more than others, I was confident that the dataset used to train was not diverse to cover more niche or unknown combinations. Secondly, I had reason to believe that the discriminator network is not particularly trying to optimize on the background or accessories in the images, and hence  distortion (commonly seen in the early training cycles of a GAN) is more likely for backgrounds and accessories.

Considering a reasonable timeframe that I could afford, I decided to click through one hundred images from the website and document every face that had something clearly out of the ordinary. The images recorded from this small experiment can be found [here](https://github.com/rohanfaiyazkhan/report-on-this-person-does-not-exist).

To summarize the results, from a hundred images I found a noticeable defect in 15 of them. Almost all of them were issues with accessories or the background. However, some also had issues rendering fingers, where the fingers look elongated or distorted. Here are some notable examples.

### Accessory Issues

Distortions on the face and headdress.

### Fingers issue

Earring flowers merging with hair, and fingers and neck appear distorted.
